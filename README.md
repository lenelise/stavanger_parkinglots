**Note:** This is a work in progress. 

This project came to life when I, out of the blue, hit a serious case of certification fatigue. At that point I had been in the IT consultant industry for 6 months, and it had been 6 months of continously taking courses, with an explicit expectation that I should take as many certifications as I possible. 

For a long time I had enjoyed it, learning things I had had on my wish-list for years. But this early April morning, my brain said stop. After a couple of hours trying to force myself to study for Microsoft's PL-300, I decided that it was time to shift focus, experiment, and play around with the things I already knew, focusing on having fun.

I decided that whatever I was to spend the next days or weeks on, it should ideally not be *useful*. I figures the more useless of a project, the higher the chances would be of having fun, and re-gaining my motivation (*spoiler alert:* this turned out be a really effective strategy). 

After searching for a good dataset (wihtout having any idea what "good" would mean in this context), I ended up with  two similar data sets from Stavanger, showing the occupancy of different parking lots. 

I decided to explore them further because they had some qualities I found appealing: 
- the data seems to be pretty much useless for me. I don't drive, and I have only been in Stavanger once in my life. The data seemed to be irrelevant for me in every way possible, which I hoped would mean the pressure for doing something "useful" would be minimal.
- the data has a lot of observations: 24 per day for 2 years across 9 different parking lots. So I hoped this meant it had  potential when it came to plotting and finding (visual) patterns.
- I have no prior knowledge of Stavanger or where these parking lots are relative to the city center, airports, hotels, malls or other landmarks. For example, I would assume a parking lot in the city center has more traffic than some remote parking lot, but I have no clue which lot in the data sets that falls into this category (if any). 
- The data is fairly simple. I did not have to spend time reading up on domain-specific terms to find out what a column "really means". I could just go straight to the things I wanted to: exploration! 

I did not have any goal going into this little project, but the outcomes ended up being: 

- learning a lot of new things in python matplotlib library.
- getting hands on experience exploring and cleaning an unfamiliar and "real" dataset
- regaining the faith in my programmatic and mathematical abilities
