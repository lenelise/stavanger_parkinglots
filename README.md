This project came to life when I, out of the blue, hit a serious case of certification fatigue. At that point I had been in the IT consultant industry for 6 months, and it had been 6 months of taking courses, with an explicit expectation from the management that I should get as many certifications as I possible. 

For a long time I had enjoyed it, learning things I had had on my wish-list for years. But this warm April morning, my brain said stop. After a couple of hours trying to force myself to study for Microsoft's PL-300,  I decided that it was time to shift focus, experiment, and play around with the things I already knew, focusing on having fun.

I decided that whatever I was to spend the next days or weeks on, it should ideally not be *useful*. The more useless, the better. 

After searhing around for a good dataset, I ended up with these two similar data sets from Stavanger. I decided to explore them further because they had some qualities I found appealing: 
- the data seems to be pretty much useless for me. I don't drive, and I have only been in Stavanger once in my life, so the data is irrelevant for my life
- the data has a lot of observations, 24 each day for 2 years. So I figured it had some potential when it came to plotting and finding (visual) patterns
- the data is not very complex. I did not have to spend time reading up on terms to find out what a column "really means". I could just go straight to the things I wanted to: exploration!

I have used the procjet to get practice exploring, cleaning and experimenting with new and unfamiliar data, as well as visualizing the data in new ways - either by new libraries, or choosing visualisations other then the *standard* (although some standard plots are present in the report)
